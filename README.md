# Simple_Sentiment_Analysis

##Description
Here we will 'analyse sentiments' in a dataset of IMDB movie reviews. 
We'll create a wrapper for this classification.
We'll classify the reviews as Positive(1 - good movie) or Negative(0 - bad movie) using TensorFlow's tflearn library.

The neural network that is built for this is a recurrent network. It uses a technique called LSTM which helps with the
long term dependencies in neural networks analysing words, sentences and paragraphs.
